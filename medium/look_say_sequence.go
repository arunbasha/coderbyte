//Look Say Sequence (TODO: Question not clear)
//Find the next number in the sequence according to the following rule:
//Generate the next number in a sequence read off the digits of the given number, counting the number of digits in groups
//of the same digit. For example, the sequence beginning with 1 would be: 1, 11, 21, 1211, ...
//The 11 comes from there being "one 1" before it and the 21 comes from there being "two 1's" before it. So your program
//should return the next number in the sequence given num.
